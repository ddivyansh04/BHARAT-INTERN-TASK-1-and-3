Predicting house prices using Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor

Title: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor

Description:

In the ever-evolving real estate market, accurately predicting house prices is of paramount importance for both buyers and sellers. This project explores two powerful machine learning techniques, Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor, to help you make informed decisions in the housing market.

Linear Regression: Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, house prices) and one or more independent variables (features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.). By fitting a linear equation to the data, Linear Regression provides insights into how each feature impacts the house price. It offers transparency and simplicity, making it an ideal choice for understanding the basic drivers of house prices.

Gradient Boosting Regressor: Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to create a powerful predictive model. Gradient Boosting Regressor, in particular, excels at capturing complex relationships within the data. It builds a sequence of decision trees, where each subsequent tree corrects the errors made by the previous ones. This iterative process results in a highly accurate and robust model, making it well-suited for predicting house prices, which can be influenced by numerous factors and intricate patterns.

In this project, we delve into the process of predicting house prices using both Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor. We cover the following key aspects:

Data Preprocessing: We begin by preparing the dataset, cleaning and encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and scaling numerical features to ensure that our models can make meaningful predictions.

Model Training: We train both the Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor models using the preprocessed data. We explore how each model leverages the data to make predictions and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.

Evaluation Metrics: To assess the performance of our models, we employ various evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) to quantify how well they predict house prices.

Model Comparison: We provide a comprehensive comparison between the Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor models, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations in the context of house price prediction.

Interpretability: We discuss the interpretability of each model, allowing you to gain insights into the factors that influence house prices.
